# WP Post Via Ajax Shortcode

This plugin creates a shortcode `[pva]` using `wp_insert_post()` function, which will allow users to create a post via the front-end. For now it's only a very basic start to serve as a jumping off point to develop more complicated uses; the idea is just to get the basic mechanic of posting via AJAX working.
